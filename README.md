# Tarot To Go

### Abstract
Tarot To Go is for Mystics on the Go!  In a fast paced digital era, sometimes it can be difficult to make/find space to do a Tarot reading.  Tarot To Go has got you covered!

### User Interaction
A user is able to set an intention for their reading and solidify it by typing it into the Intention/Question input field.

From there the user can click on "Draw A Single Card" for a quick reading or "3 Card Spread" to get deeper insight on the Past-Present-Future of the situation/question at hand.
